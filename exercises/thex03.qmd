# Overview

## Setting the Scene

\<add context\>

bal bla we are lookign at 5 storey HDB bla bla

## Objectives

Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) hold tremendous potential to address complex problems facing society. In this study, you are tasked to apply appropriate Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) and Emerging Hot Spot Analysis (EHSA) to undercover the spatio-temporal trends of COVID-19 vaccination in DKI Jakarta.

## Tasks

In this take-home exercise, you are tasked to predict HDB resale prices at the sub-market level (i.e. HDB 3-room, HDB 4-room and HDB 5-room) for the month of January and February 2023 in Singapore. The predictive models must be built by using by using conventional OLS method and GWR methods. You are also required to compare the performance of the conventional OLS method versus the geographical weighted methods.

# Getting Started

## Installing and Loading Packages

Next, pacman assists us by helping us load R packages that we require, `sf`, `tidyverse` and funModeling.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(readxl, sf, tidyverse, tmap, sfdep, gifski, httr, jsonlite)
```

The following packages assists us to accomplish the following:

-   *readxl* assists us in importing `.xlsx` aspatial data without having to convert to `.csv`

-   *sf* helps to import, manage and process vector-based geospatial data in R

-   *tidyverse* which includes *readr* to import delimited text file, *tidyr* for tidying data and *dplyr* for wrangling data

-   *tmap* provides functions to allow us to plot high quality static or interactive maps using leaflet API

-   *gifski* helps us to handle the GIF animation for tmap

## 

## Data Acquisition

The following datasets would be used to create the predictive models using conventional OLS and GWR methods for HDB Resale Prices.

## Data Fields

The data fields we are looking to incorporate and work with in our predictive models includes:

::: panel-tabset
## Structural Factors

-   Area of the unit

-   Floor level

-   Remaining lease

-   Age of the unit

-   Main Upgrading Program (MUP) completed

    -   Extracted MUP and Home Improvment Programme (HIP) data from HDB website

    -   For HDB units that has received HIP, their home value may be affected positively than a similar aged flat that has not received it

-   Relative Age of Remaining Lead to Mean of Remaining Lease Left within 1km (+ if newer, - if older than area)

    -   If a HDB estate is relatively newer than HDBs in the area, homeowners might be enticed to buy newer HDB units in the area

-   Apartment Type (eg. DBSS/Standard/Premium)

    -   Design Build Sell Scheme (DBSS) flats may call for a higher value than regular HDB flats as they are designed, build and sold by 3rd party developers although they are still HDB Flats. They are supposed to be better than premium flats

    -   Premium flats which come with pre-installed fittings and furnishings over standard apartments which comes with none

    -   Reference: https://www.teoalida.com/singapore/hdbflattypes/

-   Apartment Multi-story (Maisonette or Loft)

    -   Some homeowners may prefer multi-story HDBs over single-story ones

## Vocational Factors

-   Proximity to CBD

-   Proximity to eldercare

-   Proximity to foodcourt/hawker centres

-   Proximity to MRT

-   Proximity to park

-   Proximity to good primary school

-   Proximity to shopping mall

-   Proximity to supermarket

-   Numbers of kindergartens within 350m

-   Numbers of childcare centres within 350m

-   Numbers of bus stop within 350m

-   Numbers of primary school within 1km

-   Proximity to Overhead MRT Line \[noise concern\] (if \<300m)

    -   The closer a HDB unit is to the MRT track, the home value might be affected due to noise concerns. We measure the proximity of HDB units using its euclidean distance to the closest part of the MRT track if it is less than 300metres away.

-   Number of Future MRT stops within 800m (10min walk)

    -   Here, I want to explore how the resale values of HDBs could be affected by future MRT stations that are announced but not yet built. Home owners may be enticed to buy houses near future MRT lines in hopes that the house values will increase and also due to increased connectivity

-   Number of LRT Stops within 350m

    -   The metric is necessary as LRT serves as a feeder within the town and is typically used short-haul vs MRT which is between various towns. The 350m metric is derived from Bus Stops differentiates the weight between a LRT stop and MRT stop especially if the LRT stop is far away from the MRT stop in towns such as Sengkang, Punggol and Pasir Ris

# Data Wrangling: Aspatial Data

\<list of datasets to import and handle\> and type of treatment

## Importing Aspatial Data

In the various tabs below, we will import each individual dataset from its respective folders, with a brief explanation of the use cases of each dataset.

::: panel-tabset
## CHAS Clinics

```{r}
CHAS_raw = read_xlsx("Take-Home_Ex03/aspatial/CHAS.xlsx") 
glimpse(CHAS_raw)
```

## HDB HIP MUP

```{r}
hdb_hip_mup_raw = read_xlsx("Take-Home_Ex03/aspatial/HDB_HIP-MUP-20230312.xlsx")
glimpse(hdb_hip_mup_raw)
```

## HDB Resale Flat Pricing

```{r}
hdb_resale_raw = read_csv("Take-Home_Ex03/aspatial/resale-flat-prices-based-on-registration-date-from-jan-2017-onwards.csv")
glimpse(hdb_resale_raw)
```
:::

## Filtering HDB Resale Flat Data

We will now filter the HDB Resale to focus on the target months, Jan 2020 to Feb 2023, and 5 Room HDBs to construct the predictive model. We will use:

-   *filter()* to filter out the desired room type and months

-   *unique()* to check if the desired room type and months has been filtered correctly

-   *glimpse()* to check the data structure of the filtered dataset

::: panel-tabset
## Filter Code

```{r}
hdb_resale <- filter(hdb_resale_raw, flat_type == "5 ROOM") %>%
              filter(month >= "2020-01" & month <= "2023-02")
```

## Glimpse Variables

```{r}
glimpse(hdb_resale)
```

## Unique Month and Flat_Type

```{r}
unique(hdb_resale$month)
```

```{r}
unique(hdb_resale$flat_type)
```
:::

From the code and results in the respective tabs (Glimpse Variables and Unique Month and Flat Type), we can see that:

-   There are **21,500 transactions** between Jan 2020 to Feb 2023.

-   The `month` and `flat_type` has been extracted correctly.

## Transforming Aspatial Data - Create New Columns with Values

Next, we transform the Aspatial Datasets into more meaningful values:

1.  CHAS Clinics - There is nothing to transform, since as noted earlier, there is already a `postal` column provided
2.  HDB HIP MUP - We need to obtain the address for geocoding (obtaining the SVY21 `X` and `Y` coordinates) by combining the `BLK` and `STREET` fields
3.  HDB Resale Flat Pricing - We need to obtain the address for geocoding (obtaining the SVY21 `X` and `Y` coordinates) by combining the `block` and `street_name` fields, and also convert the remaining lease from the form of `YY years MM months` to a more machine-readable format (ie. `MM` months)

The code chunks will assist with the transformation using *mutate()* further explained below:

::: panel-tabset
## HDB HIP MUP

We *mutate()* the `hdb_hip_mup_raw` dataset by pasting the `BLK` and `STREET` columns together into the `address` column to a new sf dataframe called `hdb_hip_mup_trans`

```{r}
hdb_hip_mup_trans <- hdb_hip_mup_raw %>%
  mutate(hdb_hip_mup_raw, address = paste(BLK, STREET))
```

## HDB Resale Flat Pricing

We *mutate()* the `hdb_resale` dataset by pasting the `block` and `street_name` columns together into the `address` column to a new variable called `hdb_hip_mup_trans`. We also used *mutate()* to modify the existing `remaining_lease` data to the form of `MM`.

The first section of the code `as.integer(str_sub(remaining_lease, 0, 2)) * 12` extracts the year numbers as `YY` and converts it into string and then multiplying it by 12 to convert it to number of months.

The next part of the code checks if there is any numerical `MM` (month) present, if there is no month present, the value will be `NA` and 0 will be assigned in place of `NA`. Else, if present, we take the `MM`.

The integer month is summed with the year in months to form this column `remaining_lease_mths` in the new sf dataframe `hdb_resale_trans`

```{r}
hdb_resale_trans <- hdb_resale %>%
  mutate(hdb_resale, address = paste(block, street_name)) %>%
  mutate(hdb_resale, remaining_lease_mths = (as.integer(str_sub(remaining_lease, 0, 2)) * 12 + ifelse(is.na(as.integer(str_sub(remaining_lease, 9, 11))), 0,  as.integer(str_sub(remaining_lease, 9, 11)))))
```
:::

## Retrieving SVY21 Coordinate of Addresses

This section will focus on retrieving relavant data such as coordinates of the address which we could use in further spatial analysis to obtain proximity to locational factors later.

We are interested in obtaining the `SVY21` `X` and `Y` coordinates as they are in the Projected Coordinate System, which allows us to perform measure directly without any additional transformations.

### Create a List Storing Unique Addresses/Postal Codes

Since some addresses/postal codes are duplicated, we store and check unique addresses to reduce the amount of `GET` requests sent to the OneMap API:

1.  Faster
2.  OneMap API has a rate limit of 250 API calls a minute
3.  It makes it easier for us to locate errors and correct it

Here, we will obtain a list of unique addresses/postal codes for each data set.

::: panel-tabset
## CHAS Clinics

```{r}
addr_lst.chas <- sort(unique(CHAS_raw$Postal))
```

## HDB HIP MUP

```{r}
addr_lst.hipmup <- sort(unique(hdb_hip_mup_trans$address))
```

## HDB Resale Flat Pricing

```{r}
addr_lst.resale <- sort(unique(hdb_resale_trans$address))
```
:::

## 

```{r}
#tmap_mode("view")
#tm_shape(hdb_resale) +
#  tm_dots("resale_price",
#          popup.vars=c("month"="month", "town"="town", "block" = "block", "street_name" = "street_name"))
```

```{r}
mpsz = st_read(dsn = "Take-Home_Ex03/geospatial", layer="MPSZ-2019")
```
