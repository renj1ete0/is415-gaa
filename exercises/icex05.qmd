# Getting Started

## Installing and Loading Packages

Firstly, the code below will check if **pacman** has been installed. If it has not been installed, R will download and install it, before activating it for use during this session.

```{r}
if (!require('pacman', character.only = T)){
  install.packages('pacman')
}
library('pacman')
```

Next, pacman assists us by helping us load R packages that we require, `sf`, `tidyverse` and `tmap`.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, tmap, sf, sfdep)
```

## Importing Data

```{r}
studyArea <- st_read(dsn = "In-Class_Ex05/data", layer = "study_area") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3829)
```

```{r}
stores <- st_read(dsn = "In-Class_Ex05/data", layer = "stores") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3829)
```

## Visualising SF Layers

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(studyArea) +
  tm_polygons() +
tm_shape(stores) +
  tm_dots(col = "Name",
          size = 0.01,
          border.col = "black",
          border.lwd = 0.5) +
tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(12,16))
```

::: callout-note
The polygon layers should always be above the dots. The geospatial layers are rendered in sequence, hence if polygons are rendered after the dots (ie. dots are ontop of the polygon code), the dots might be coverd by the polygon line/fill.

# Local Colocation Quotients (LCLQ)

```{r}
nb <- include_self(
  st_knn(st_geometry(stores), 6))
wt <- st_kernel_weights(nb, stores, "gaussian")
```

The variable *nb* stores the values of its neighbours. The number *6* defines 6 points including itself and 5 other neighbours.

The variable *wt* will balance weights according to distance to centre point. The further points will get lower weights.

```{r}
FamilyMart <- stores %>%
  filter(Name == "Family Mart")
A <- FamilyMart$Name

SevenEleven <- stores %>%
  filter(Name == "7-Eleven")
B <- SevenEleven$Name

LCLQ <- local_colocation(A, B, nb, wt, 49) #49 = 50 simulations and immediately see p value

LCLQ_stores <- cbind(stores, LCLQ)

tmap_mode("view")
```

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(studyArea) +
  tm_polygons() +
tm_shape(LCLQ_stores) +
  tm_dots(col = "X7.Eleven",
          size = 0.01,
          border.col = "black",
          border.lwd = 0.5) +
tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(12,16))
```
